        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer and the former
          captain of the Indian national cricket team who plays as a
          right-handed batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and
          for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. Widely regarded as one of the
          greatest batsmen of all time,Kohli holds the records for scoring
          most runs in T20 internationals and in the IPL. In 2020, the
          International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the
          decade. Kohli has also contributed to India's successes, including
          winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy. Born and
          raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy
          and started his youth career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his
          international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI
          team and later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the
          number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first
          time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs
          scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone,
          becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only
          Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of
          the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became the first player
          to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli
          made the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian national
          team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he
          stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.
